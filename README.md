# Technology Nation/CS50 Computer Sience
This project is supposed to contain all the programmes created during weekly meetings. The main 
gaol of those meetings is discussion of the course's material. CS50 course involves simple 
examples written in C to get familiar with basic programming approaches.

All the content is structured according to the course's weeks.
The major part of programmes from the first weeks are single C files. They are compiled and 
run in https://ide.cs50.io
